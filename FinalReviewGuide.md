### Agile

* Describe why agile software development was created(Agile provides opportunities to assess the direction of a project throughout the development lifecycle. In waterfall, development teams only have one chance to get each aspect of a project right. In an agile paradigm, every aspect of development â€” requirements, design, etc.)
* Explain why each of the core practices of Extreme Programming (XP) are effective(Sit together,Energized work,Weekly cycle,Slack,Test-first programming,Incremental design)
* Explain why each of the corollary practices of XP may be effective(Real customer involvement,Incremental deployment,Team continuity,Shrinking teams,Shared code.For example, daily deployment is useless if your team ships code filled with errors.)
* Analyze which XP practices are applicable you should use in your team
* Explain how to apply scrum and iteration planning to a project.(Teams planning by selecting stories from product backlog and commiting a set of them for execution in the upcoming iteration.)

### Design/Patterns/APIs

* Design notation(Dynamic:Data flow diagrams (DFDs).State transition diagrams (STDs).Statecharts.Structure diagrams.Static:
 Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).Class diagrams.Structure charts.Object diagrams.)
* Understand use cases, wireframes, storyboards(A wireframe is a view schematic that captures all layout and content decisions of that view.A storyboard illustrates the timeline of user performing a task as a sequence of frames.A use case is a list of actions or event steps, typically defining the interactions between a role and a system, to achieve a goal.)
* Understand core concepts related Design Patterns
* Identify an architecture when you see it
* Pick an appropriate architecture for a problem
* Compare and contrast architectural choices
* Understand MVVM and databinding
* How to design an API
* Understand REST verbs 
* Explain REST principles
* Explain difference between a framework and API
* Use and explain above concepts in designing a product.

### Testing

* List and define different types of testing (e.g. acceptance testing vs integration testing)
* Compare and contrast black-box testing and white-box testing
* Generating test cases based on black-box testing.
* Generating test cases based on white-box testing.
* Define test harness, tear-down, setup, test cases, test suite, assertions
* Explain Test-driven testing (TDD)
* Implement unit tests and necessary assertions for testing a system.
Design a detailed testing strategy for a product, with appropriate arguments for types of testing used, explanations of trade-offs, and concrete implementation plans.
* Define mocking.
* Explain mocking versus other approaches (e.g. dependency injection)
* Explain advantages and disadvantages of mocking.
* Implement mocking of RESTful services, database, or file system interfaces.
* Explain web testing with selenium
* Implement xpath expressions for asserting web page behavior

### Metrics/Static Analysis

* Understand metrics, including complexity, OO, and other techniques.
* Understand and derive program graph from code snippet.
* Define line, branch, condition, branch-condition and MCDC coverage.
* Explain subsumption and why and when one type of coverage may subsume another.
* Calculate line, branch, condition coverage.
* Identify other kinds of coverage: path coverage, mutation testing, data-flow coverage.
* Explain benefits and disadvantages of using Visitor pattern in static analysis.
* Identify several uses cases for static analysis.
* Explain issues and benefits related to static analysis (e.g. versus dynamic analysis or verification.).
* Implement static analysis for measuring errors or code quality measures.
